- Austins Group: This team presented a weather application with a unique set of features that helped it stand out among the projects. However, their demonstration was limited due to a backend crash. They utilized a weather API for predicting weather trends and effectively displayed real-time temperatures using a separate API on the frontend. While the user interface was praiseworthy, the functionality of the five-year weather prediction graph could not be showcased. All in all, considering the project's uniqueness and potential, it deserves a rating of 4.8 out of 5, with some features left unexplored due to the backend crash.

- Hanlun's Group: Hanlun's Group impressed with their chess application, especially the Yeongsu Demo, which showcased an elegant and functional chess game. They integrated the Whisp chatting system with a UI reminiscent of popular platforms like Discord. What makes this project unique is how the chess game communicates move changes via post requests to AWS and displays the moves on the opponent's side. The Whisp also stands out for its ability to edit the database through a URL, providing valuable moderation features. The chess game excels in terms of functionality, although the Whisp could benefit from further user management features. Overall, the project deserves a rating of 8.8 out of 9, showcasing its uniqueness and impressive functionality.

- Advik's Group: This team presented an engaging project with a touch of humor, targeting a specific audience with a Breaking Bad theme. The concept of a song finder was intriguing, but it couldn't be fully demonstrated due to server crashes. Their Breaking Bad simulator added a fun and entertaining dimension to the project. They effectively implemented a backend that communicated with the frontend for music-related tasks. Usability could be enhanced with more attention to frontend design, but the project's functional core holds promise with further refinement. Overall, the project garners a rating of 8.7 out of 9 for its impressive features.
